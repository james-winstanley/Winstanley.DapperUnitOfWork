# Base Unit of Work and Repository for Dapper

Inspired by Tim Schreiber's (modified by Cheena Malhotra) Dapper unit of work example:
https://github.com/timschreiber/DapperUnitOfWork
https://github.com/cheenamalhotra/DapperUnitOfWork

This is used as a base library for other unit of work + repository projects, and supports MsSql, MySql, SqLite, and PostgreSql.
